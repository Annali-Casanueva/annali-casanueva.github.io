I study the causes and effects of modern social movements, using original and rich data sources, with a specific focus on the role of social media. I am particularly interested in empowering movements affecting minorities and marginalized groups.

 * *Can chants in the street change politics' tune? Evidence from the 15M movement in Spain*{: .papertitle } -- [Latest version](/docs/effects-15m.pdf) 
 
   *Abstract:* What are the long term effects of protests? This paper studies
   how the level of attendance at simultaneous marches organized by the *15M*
   (the Spanish Occupy movement) impacted electoral behavior and political
   attitudes in the following decade. Using regional variation in weather shocks
   as an instrumental variable for the level of attendance at simultaneous
   marches, I find that cities with higher attendance are more concerned about
   corruption and vote more for left wing and anti-corruption parties and less
   for far-right parties. Using novel data from Twitter, I document, for the
   first time, a higher uptake of social media platforms after an offline
   protest and a persistent difference in online activity in cities with higher
   attendance. Using survey data, I also show a higher and longer-lasting
   electoral effect for people that have a social media account. Overall, this
   paper shows that street protests can have long-lasting effects on political
   concerns and electoral choices, explained, in part, by the creation of a
   persistent online social network.

* *Going Viral in a Pandemic: Social Media and the Broadening of the Black Lives Matter Movement*{: .papertitle } -- [Current draft](/docs/Black-Lives-Matter-and-COVID-19.pdf).
   Joint with Avetian, Vladimir; Sardoschau, Sulin; and Saxena, Kritika.
   
   *Abstract:* How do modern social movements broaden their base?
   Prompted by the viral video footage of George Floyd's murder, the
   Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement gained unprecedented scope in the
   spring of 2020. In this paper, we show that pandemic exposure
   (COVID-19 related deaths) significantly increased the take-up of
   social media and subsequently mobilized new segments of society to
   join the movement for the first time. We exploit Super Spreader
   Events in the early stages of the pandemic as a source of plausibly
   exogenous variation at the county level and develop a novel index
   of social media penetration, using information from more than 45
   million tweets, google searches and mobility data. Our results
   suggest that social media can be persuasive and inspire action
   outside of traditional coalitions.

* *Triggers and barriers to political empowerment: Evidence from Black Lives Matter*{: .papertitle } -- [Current draft](/docs/Triggers-and-barriers-to-political-empowerment-evidence-from-BLM.pdf)

   *Abstract:* This paper sudies the triggers, barriers and factors favoring political empowerment through
   protest in the context of the Black Lives Matter movement (BLM) in the period 2014--2018 in the
   US. Using high-profile police-caused deaths of Blacks as a quasi-exogenous national protest
   trigger, and two-way fixed effects for counties and days, I study the differential effects of
   various local characteristics on offline protest behavior and online BLM activity. After
   confirming that police-related Black deaths are an important predictor of protests, and more so
   in places with a higher share of Black population, results show the following: 1) Past protest in
   the county itself and in surrounding areas increase the likelihood of observing a BLM event after
   a new trigger, even more so if past protest are larger, are closer geographically to the county
   or are closer in time to the date of a new trigger; 2) past local police-related deaths are
   linked to an increase in BLM protest and online discussion after a non-local police-related death
   that gained national media attention 3) economic resource deprivation reduces both protest
   behavior and online engagement in BLM debates, suggesting the existence of a "protest poverty
   trap"; 4) higher inequality increases the number of protests but not the likelihood of observing
   a first protest in a county that has never protested before, suggesting that unfavorable local
   context can be reinterpreted after exposure to a more negative narrative about it (for example
   during a protest); 5) more social links are related to an increase of the number of protests but
   not to the likelihood of observing a first protest, suggesting that having experienced a protest
   can reveal information about others' political preferences in the region, allowing individuals to
   be less reluctant when taking advantage of their social network to push forward their protest
   agenda; 6) a higher ability to participate in formal ways in the political debate (such as
   participating in elections) reduces the protest behavior, suggesting that formal and informal
   means of political participation substitute each other.

* *The Cost of Tolerating Intolerance: Right-wing Protest and Hate Crimes*{: .papertitle }-- [Current draft](/docs/The cost of tolerating intolerance.pdf). Joint with Sardoschau, Sulin.

   *Abstract:* Freedom of speech is central to democracy, but protests that amplify extremist views expose a critical trade-off between civil liberties and public safety. This paper investigates how right-wing demonstrations affect the incidence of hate crimes, focusing on Germany's largest far-right movement since World War II. Leveraging a difference-in-differences framework with instrumental variable and event-study approaches, we find that a 20% increase in local protest attendance nearly doubles hate crime occurrences. We explore three potential mechanisms—signaling, agitation, and coordination—by examining protest dynamics, spatial diffusion, media influence, counter-mobilization, and crime characteristics. Our analysis reveals that large protests primarily act as signals of broad xenophobic support, legitimizing extremist violence. This signaling effect propagates through right-wing social media networks and is intensified by local newspaper coverage and Twitter discussions. Consequently, large protests shift local equilibria, resulting in sustained higher levels of violence primarily perpetrated by repeat offenders. Notably, these protests trigger resistance predominantly online, rather than physical counter-protests.

* *Diffusion of protest through Social Media: Evidence from Nahel protest in France*{: .papertitle }, joint with Meón, Pierre Guillaume and Stephan, Paul.

    *Abstract:* We study how social media contribute to the geographic diffusion of riots. To do so, we study how riots spurred by the death of Nahel Merzouk in the hands of the police in France spread over mainland France in the early summer of 2023. From 27 June to 4 July, violent protests involving several thousand participants took place in 553 municipalities, including municipalities that had never witnessed that type of event. We use the geolocation of posts and comments on TikTok and Instagram talking about the death of Nahel Merzouk to create a measure of network exposure to previous riots in municipalities without any previous riots. Exploiting the panel dimension of social media posts and riots, we find that higher exposure to riots on a day increases the probability of hosting a riot on the day that follows. The effect is higher if the municipality has a higher share of young population and a higher share of immigrants.

 * [Impact of switching bug trackers: a case study on a medium-sized open source project](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01951176){: .papertitle }.
   Joint work with Zimmermann, Théo. 2019 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME).

   *Abstract:* For most software projects, the bug tracker is an essential tool. In open source
   development, this tool plays an even more central role as it is generally open to all users, who
   are encouraged to test the software and report bugs. Previous studies have highlighted the act of
   reporting a bug as a first step leading a user to become an active contributor. The impact of the
   bug reporting environment on the bug tracking activity is difficult to assess because of the lack
   of comparison points. In this paper, we take advantage of the switch, from Bugzilla to GitHub, of
   the bug tracker of Coq, a medium-sized open source project, to evaluate and interpret the impact
   that such a change can have. We first report on the switch itself, including the migration of
   preexisting issues. Then we analyze data from before and after the switch using a regression
   discontinuity design, an econometric methodology imported from quantitative policy analysis. We
   complete this quantitative analysis with qualitative data from interviews with developers. We
   show that the switch induces an increase in bug reporting, particularly from principal developers
   themselves, and more generally an increased engagement with the bug tracking platform, with more
   comments by developers and also more external commentators.
