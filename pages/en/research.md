I study the effects and determinants of modern protest using original and rich data sources, with a specific focus on the role of social media. I am particularly interested in protests affecting minorities and marginalized groups.

 * [Impact of switching bug trackers: a case study on a medium-sized open source project](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01951176){: .papertitle }.
   Joint work with Zimmermann, Théo. 2019 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME).

   *Abstract:* For most software projects, the bug tracker is an essential tool. In open source
   development, this tool plays an even more central role as it is generally open to all users, who
   are encouraged to test the software and report bugs. Previous studies have highlighted the act of
   reporting a bug as a first step leading a user to become an active contributor. The impact of the
   bug reporting environment on the bug tracking activity is difficult to assess because of the lack
   of comparison points. In this paper, we take advantage of the switch, from Bugzilla to GitHub, of
   the bug tracker of Coq, a medium-sized open source project, to evaluate and interpret the impact
   that such a change can have. We first report on the switch itself, including the migration of
   preexisting issues. Then we analyze data from before and after the switch using a regression
   discontinuity design, an econometric methodology imported from quantitative policy analysis. We
   complete this quantitative analysis with qualitative data from interviews with developers. We
   show that the switch induces an increase in bug reporting, particularly from principal developers
   themselves, and more generally an increased engagement with the bug tracking platform, with more
   comments by developers and also more external commentators.

 * *From the street to the polls: social movements, social media and elections.
   Evidence from the Indignados movement in Spain.*{: .papertitle }
 
   *Abstract:* What are the long term effects of protests? This paper studies how the level of
   attendance at simultaneous marches organized by the *Indignados* (the Spanish Occupy movement)
   impacted electoral behavior and political attitudes in the following decade. Using regional
   variation in weather shocks as an instrumental variable for the level of attendance, I find that
   cities with higher attendance are more concerned about corruption and vote more for left wing and
   anti-corruption parties and less for far-right parties. Using novel data from Twitter, I
   document, for the first time, a higher uptake of social media platforms after an offline protest
   and a persistent difference in online activity in cities with higher attendance. Using survey
   data, I also show a higher and longer-lasting electoral effect for people that have a social
   media account. Overall, this paper shows that street protests can have long-lasting effects on
   political concerns and electoral choices, explained, in part, by the creation of a persistent
   online social network.

 * *Going Viral in a Pandemic: Social Media and the Broadening of the Black Lives Matter Movement*{: .papertitle }.
   Joint with Avetian, Vladimir; Sardoschau, Sulin; and Saxena, Kritika.
   
   *Abstract:* How do modern social movements broaden their base? Prompted by the viral video
   footage of George Floyd's murder, the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement gained unprecedented
   scope in the spring of 2020. Exploiting Super Spreader Events in the early stages of the pandemic
   as a source of plausibly exogenous variation, we find that pandemic exposure (COVID-19 related
   deaths) led to an increase in the likelihood of observing a BLM protest in counties with no prior
   BLM protest. Using evidence from more than 45 million tweets, we show that pandemic exposure
   significantly increased the take-up of social media and subsequently mobilized new segments of
   society to join the movement for the first time. We find supporting evidence using
   individual-level survey data and rule out competing channels. Our results suggest that social
   media can be persuasive and inspire action outside of traditional coalitions.

 * *Triggers and barriers to political empowerment: Evidence from Black Lives Matter*{: .papertitle }.

   *Abstract:* This paper sudies the triggers, barriers and factors favoring political empowerment through
   protest in the context of the Black Lives Matter movement (BLM) in the period 2014--2018 in the
   US. Using high-profile police-caused deaths of Blacks as a quasi-exogenous national protest
   trigger, and two-way fixed effects for counties and days, I study the differential effects of
   various local characteristics on offline protest behavior and online BLM activity. After
   confirming that police-related Black deaths are an important predictor of protests, and more so
   in places with a higher share of Black population, results show the following: 1) Past protest in
   the county itself and in surrounding areas increase the likelihood of observing a BLM event after
   a new trigger, even more so if past protest are larger, are closer geographically to the county
   or are closer in time to the date of a new trigger; 2) past local police-related deaths are
   linked to an increase in BLM protest and online discussion after a non-local police-related death
   that gained national media attention 3) economic resource deprivation reduces both protest
   behavior and online engagement in BLM debates, suggesting the existence of a "protest poverty
   trap"; 4) higher inequality increases the number of protests but not the likelihood of observing
   a first protest in a county that has never protested before, suggesting that unfavorable local
   context can be reinterpreted after exposure to a more negative narrative about it (for example
   during a protest); 5) more social links are related to an increase of the number of protests but
   not to the likelihood of observing a first protest, suggesting that having experienced a protest
   can reveal information about others' political preferences in the region, allowing individuals to
   be less reluctant when taking advantage of their social network to push forward their protest
   agenda; 6) a higher ability to participate in formal ways in the political debate (such as
   participating in elections) reduces the protest behavior, suggesting that formal and informal
   means of political participation substitute each other.
