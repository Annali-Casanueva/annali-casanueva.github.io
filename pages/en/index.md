![Portrait]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/annali-casanueva-portrait.jpeg){: .main-page-portrait}

I am an empirical political economist. I study the effects and determinants of modern protest using original and rich data sources, with a specific focus on the role of social media. 
I am particularly interested in protests affecting minorities and marginalized groups.

I also enjoy [playing with clay]({{ site.baseurl }}/en/ceramic/)!
