I am an empirical political economist currently working at Ifo institute in Munich as a big data junior research group leader and assitant professor (non tenure-track). I study the causes and effects of modern protests, with a specific focus on the role of social media.

I use original and rich data sources to show: how street protests can change electoral behavior in the long run through social media networks; how social media exposure can broaden the base of sympathizers of minority groups' protests; and how far-right protests can encourage hate crimes against migrants.

In addition, I am collaborating with empirical software engineering researchers to apply econometric methods to the development of open-source software projects.
