![Portrait]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/annali-casanueva-portrait.jpeg){: .main-page-portrait}

I am an empirical political economist. I study the causes and effects of modern protests, with a specific focus on the role of social media.

I use original and rich data sources to show: how street protests can change electoral behavior in the long run through social media networks; how social media exposure can broaden the base of sympathizers of minority groups' protests; and how far-right protests can encourage hate crimes against migrants.

In addition, I am collaborating with empirical software engineering researchers to apply econometric methods to the development of open-source software projects.

I also enjoy [playing with clay]({{ site.baseurl }}/en/ceramic/)!
